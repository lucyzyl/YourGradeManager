# My Personal Project: Your Grade Manager

## What is "Your Grade Manager" about?

"Your Grade Manager" allows you to:
- **Keep** your course grade once you create a course and add an assignment grade.
- **Predict** the minimum grade you need to get for an assignment or assessment category (i.e: your midterm, final, or major project) in order to achieve your desired final mark.
- **Calculate** the final grade of a course based on the assessment weight.
- **Calculate** the GPA of your chosen courses.

## Introduction:

### What will the application do?
**"Your Grade Manager"**, as its name suggested, 
is an application dedicated to calculating all sorts of 
grades, including **firstly**, recording assessment grades within a course and overall
mark of a course, **secondly**, predicting one of the assessment grades given the target
final mark, and **finally**, calculating the final grade of one course based on assessment grade and
weight, and the overall GPA of your chosen courses. It takes care of everything
associated with your academic performance.

### Who will use it?
The target users of "Your Grade Manager" are **HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS** and **UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS**. For ambitious and 
academic-able high school students, GPA is a vital
component of university application and undoubtedly affects
the possibility of being admitted to your dream school.
Thus, "Your Grade Manager" allows them to keep track of their
grades and be clear about their current state. It is the same idea
for undergraduate students who might need to attain the cutoff mark for a program, and apply for
the co-op or post-graduate program.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
GPA is vital to me! I am considering transferring to the combined
major in computer science and mathematics in my third year. 
However, this is not a story of "you apply you in". I
need to have a higher GPA to be more competitive. Besides, I have 
a plan to pursue my graduate degree, which indeed cares
about your GPA. I hope I can use my application to record and calculate
my own grades without carrying out complicated calculations by myself
over and over again. This application will also help me better 
allocate my time to maximize my overall GPA.
