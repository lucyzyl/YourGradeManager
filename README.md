# My Personal Project: Your Grade Manager

## Introduction:

### What will the application do?
**"Your Grade Manager"**, as its name suggested, 
is an application dedicated to calculating your
grades. It allows you to:
- Create your own course and add assessments with their weights to the course.
- Record the assessment grades of a course.
- Calculate the final grade of a course based on the assessment grades and
weights.

### Who will use it?
The target users of "Your Grade Manager" are **HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS** and **UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS**. For ambitious and 
academic-able high school students, GPA is a vital
component of university application and undoubtedly affects
the possibility of being admitted to their dream school.
Therefore, "Your Grade Manager" allows them to keep track of their
grades and be clear about their current state. It is the same idea
for undergraduate students who might need to apply for
the co-op or post-graduate program.

### Why is this project of interest to you?
Optimization is an important part of my life and using optimization to maximize my GPA is a tedious calculation I have 
to do almost every single time when there is an assignment grade released.
The current overall mark of one course tells me whether I need to spend more time on that
course. It allows me to better allocate my time. However, It is tedious to type grades and their
associated weights every single time you want to know your current grade for a course. Therefore,
my project idea comes up. What if there is an application that allows me to create my own courses
with every assessment categories and their associated weights established. Then when there 
is a grade published, I can add the grade to the assessment and the application will automatically
tells me my current mark. This application will definitely save me from my tedious and
time-consuming daily basis.
